# GenAI Testing Tutorial - Complete Application

## Overview

This repository is the working codebase and course material for a two-part GenAI testing curriculum.

Part 1 (Exercises 1-4) focuses on RAG testing fundamentals.
Part 2 (Exercises 5-9) focuses on agentic testing for routing, state, reliability, security, and CI gating.

The application is intentionally configured with realistic failure modes so students can practice detection, diagnosis, and mitigation.

## Course Flow

- Student exercises: `docs/Exercise-1.md` to `docs/Exercise-9.md`
- Instructor notes: `docs/Exercise-1-Instructor-Notes.md` to `docs/Exercise-9-Instructor-Notes.md`
- Section transition deck text: `docs/Section-Bridge-RAG-to-Agentic.md`

])

print(f"Average Quality Score: {results['average_quality_score']}")
```

### Regression Testing Integration
```python
from regression_testing.regression_testing import RegressionTestFramework

# Run tests programmatically
results = framework.run_regression_tests(save_results=True)

# Check quality gate
gate_passed = (
    results['summary']['pass_rate'] >= 0.8 and 
    results['summary']['critical_failures'] == 0
)

print(f"Quality Gate: {'PASSED' if gate_passed else 'FAILED'}")
```

## Learning Paths

### 🎓 **Beginner Track**
1. Complete student labs in order: Exercise 1 -> 4 (RAG section)
2. Deliver the section bridge before starting Exercise 5
3. Complete Exercise 5 -> 9 (agentic section)
4. Use Section 7 and 9 automation scripts for standardized evidence

### 🔬 **Intermediate Track**  
1. Map each exercise deliverable to one reusable rubric/checklist
2. Add 2-3 custom prompts per exercise to extend coverage
3. Compare baseline and post-change behavior using quick-run artifacts
4. Create a release recommendation from Exercise 9 evidence

### 🚀 **Advanced Track**
1. Extend `section7_nfr_quickrun.py` with additional NFR scenarios
2. Extend `section9_agentic_test_suite.py` with new showstopper gates
3. Integrate suite outputs into CI (artifact upload + gate decision)
4. Add production monitoring and drift checks aligned to Exercise 9

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app' or 'regression_testing'"**
- Ensure commands are run from repository root
- Use the launcher (`python launch.py`) or run `python regression_testing/regression_testing.py`

**"KeyError: 'failed_tests' or 'avg_response_length'"**
- These issues have been FIXED in the test framework
- Test data now includes all required keys for proper execution

**"Import cohere could not be resolved"**
- Ensure virtual environment is activated: `training-env\Scripts\activate`
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Use `python launch.py` to run exercise workflows consistently

**"tf-keras compatibility issues with Keras 3"**
- tf-keras has been added to requirements.txt
- Virtual environment should install tf-keras>=2.15.0 automatically  
- This resolves Keras 3 compatibility issues in the regression testing framework

**"COHERE_API_KEY not found"**
- Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
- Add your Cohere API key to the `.env` file

**"ChromaDB initialization failed"**
- Ensure you have write permissions in the project directory
- Delete `data/chroma_db/` folder and restart if corrupted

**"Flask app won't start"**
- Check that port 5000 is available
- Set `FLASK_PORT=5001` in `.env` to use a different port

### Performance Issues

**Slow first response**
- First query initializes the vector database (expected delay)
- Subsequent queries should be faster

**High memory usage**
- ChromaDB loads embeddings into memory
- Reduce document collection size if needed

### Quality Issues

**Poor response quality**
- This may be intentional! Part of the learning exercise
- Check if you're discovering the planted issues correctly

**Off-topic responses**
- Test the system's domain boundaries
- Document cases where it should vs. shouldn't know answers

## Educational Value

This application provides hands-on experience with:

### 🎯 **Core Concepts**
- **Non-deterministic Testing**: Dealing with probabilistic outputs
- **Quality vs. Performance Trade-offs**: Balancing response quality and speed
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Understanding different ways to measure success
- **Production Readiness**: What it takes to deploy GenAI systems

### 🛡️ **Safety and Robustness**
- **Hallucination Detection**: Identifying when AI generates false information
- **Bias Testing**: Checking for unfair or inappropriate responses  
- **Edge Case Handling**: System behavior with unusual inputs
- **Adversarial Robustness**: Resistance to malicious inputs

### 📈 **Performance Engineering**
- **Latency Optimization**: Making responses faster
- **Scalability Testing**: Handling multiple concurrent users
- **Resource Management**: Efficient use of CPU, memory, and API calls
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Detecting issues in production

### 🔍 **Quality Assurance**
- **Multi-dimensional Evaluation**: Beyond simple accuracy metrics
- **Consistency Testing**: Ensuring reliable behavior
- **Regression Detection**: Catching quality degradation
- **User Experience Focus**: Testing from the user's perspective
